Data source from:
https://www.esportsearnings.com/

With this project it was an aim to visualize the growth of the ESports world and all the tournaments out there.

## Totals over the years:

First I visualize the total number of cash prizes available over the years with simple bar charts, along with total number of participants and total number of tournaments.
